# scalacheck-derived

Automatic derivation of [scalacheck](https://github.com/typelevel/scalacheck) `Arbitrary` instances for Scala 3.

This enables automatic derivation for enums, case classes and sealed traits.

## Usage

There are two ways of using this library. Let's look at them by examples using the following
(example) data structure:

```
enum Color:
  case Red, Blue, Yellow

sealed trait LibItem
case class Magazine(title: String, issue: Int, color: Color) extends LibItem
case class Book(title: String, author: String, color: Color) extends LibItem
```

### a) fully implicit

By importing `io.github.martinhh.derived.scalacheck.given`, you enable implicit resolution of
derived instances so that you can do this:

```
import io.github.martinhh.derived.scalacheck.given
import org.scalacheck.Prop

Prop.forAll { (item: LibItem) =>
  // your test using item here...
}
```

### b) derive explicitly

Alternatively, you can use `io.github.martinhh.derived.scalacheck.deriveArbitrary` to explicitly
derive instances where you need them:

```
import io.github.martinhh.derived.scalacheck.deriveArbitrary
import org.scalacheck.Arbitrary

given arbLibItem: Arbitrary[LibItem] = deriveArbitrary
```
